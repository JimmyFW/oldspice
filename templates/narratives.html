<h4><a href="./#/personas/yang">The Yang Family</a></h4>
<p>
Like every weekend, the Yangs go to their favorite restaurant, the White Lotus. However due to some crazy American holiday, the restaurant is closed and they are forced to go The Red Dog, an unfamiliar restaurant, for their weekly family time. Going in, they have high hopes of the food - but are not familiar with the menu. The grandparents have the hardest time because not only are they extremely picky due to their eternal homesickness for China, but they still do not speak English very well. After minutes of frustration and translation, but they manage decide on an order. Upon ordering, they are asked how spicy they want their food. They order what they would have at The White Lotus. When the food is finally delivered, they discover it is not as appropriately spicy. In the end, precious time with the family is hampered by frustration and disappointment.</p>
<p>A successful solution would communicate these important details clearly. Not only would the Yangs be greeted by an easily understood menu, even for the grandparents, but their preferences could be easily understood in return. In the end, this experience is just like every weekend, a wonderful time with the family reminiscing about the old country. And the family tradition lives on...</p>

<h4><a href="./#/personas/blake">The Blake Family</a></h4>
<p>
The Blake family is out trying The Purple Tiger, a new restaurant suggested to them by Michelle’s co-worker. The food is a newfangled Asian-Mexican fusion style. Upon being given the menu, Michelle quickly scans the first page: “Chow Fun Burrito sampler with steak, pork, egg, fish, and oyster varieties”, “Spring roll tamales dipped in hoisin sauce”, “Garlic lobster chopped and served with rice-wheat tortilla”. She ponders: “Rice-wheat? So am I going to be allergic to this or not?” After twenty minutes of back-and-forth with the waiters, they decide to go with the Chow Fun Burrito sampler. When the meal arrives, it turns out that while Michelle can have the rice-wheat, Philicia cannot. The Blakes have to wait another ten minutes just to get a specially-made rice burrito for Philicia. Philicia pouts because it does not look as delicious as the rice-wheat burritos. Michelle feels guilty for having ordered this combo platter for everyone. The mood at the table is spoiled, as the two most fun members of the family are unhappy.</p>
<p>
A successful solution would remove the possibility of such an event occurring by specifically tailoring the menu to the group. Additionally, the menu would help the Blakes balance their order to ensure each patron was satisfied with their meal. This time, with only so many choices available on menu, a decision made in minutes. Thanks to the diverse, yet accommodating order, the Blakes can peacefully enjoy Philicia’s new round of knock-knock jokes she learned at school the previous day.</p>

<h4><a href="./#/personas/chang">Jeremy and his Guests</a></h4>
<p>
Overhearing his friends talking about going out to lunch, Jeremy jumps at the chance to suggest a new restaurant he went to last week, The Green Bull. As the Asian food expert of the group, his friends immediately trust his judgement. At the restaurant, it’s up to Jeremy to ensure they are not disappointed. He has his own idea of what the staples are, but the group has their own opinions. Questions are tossed back and forth as to what is good. Corey and Jessica bicker over whether or not to have rice with shrimp or chicken. When asked, Jeremy says they are both equally delicious. Karla seems far too insistent on having just a giant salad - which is not even Asian. She does not trust Jeremy as much as her other friends when it comes to food. In the end, Jeremy must make the executive decision. He must somehow ensure everyone gets what they want, while balancing it with enough of the best the restaurant has to offer for everyone to share. It does not help that portion size of each dish is varied. As soon as he begins to order, he gets one of the dishes wrong, causing a shoutout from Mark. The food comes, but Jeremy suddenly remembers something else everyone should try and has to wait for the the waiter to come back. After the meal and slightly delayed edition, no one is disappointed, although Jeremy feels he could have done a better job hosting his guests.</p>
<p>
A successful solution would bridge overview, collaboration, determination, and ordering into one smooth and simple process. From the the moment the group opened the menu, Jeremy could proactively dispense his plentiful knowledge. Then, during discussion, Jeremy could easily cross-reference the group’s preferences with his own plan. When the waiter comes, his selections are passed on without any hassle. Everything arrives together to maximize the dining experience. Once again, Jeremy’s friends are glad they put their trust in him.</p>

<h4><a href="./#/personas/ylc">Young Lovers Club</a></h4>
<p>
The finely dressed Young Lovers Club arrive by cab to a dimly lit Ethiopian bar and grill. As they take their seats, soft blue lights and softer electronica music populate the background. Abby Cooke pipes up: “My kite-surfing instructor says we absolutely have to try the lamb tibs.” The group examines the dish on the menu: “prime cuts of lamb sauteed with butter sauce and spices”, suddenly feeling their mouths watering. According to the kite-surfing instructor, tibs are placed in the center of a group while individuals are served injera, a type of sourdough bread which is later used by the patron to wrap bits of tibs by hand. The question was, how many pots of tibs should they order? How much injera? Starving at this point, the group orders a stack of 10 injera breads for each person, and 4 pots of tibs - one for each couple. The injera arrives, and Abby is disappointed. Each piece of bread is tiny! And thin! They order another stack. The tibs arrive in enormous pots of yummy goodness. Little did they know that injera is actually comprised of a spongy material that expands to soak up the sauce. At the end of the meal, the group was absolutely stuffed, only having consumed half of their bread, and the extra stack left untouched.</p>

<p>A successful solution would encourage exploration and adventure by providing patrons with suitable information to make informed decisions. Not every group has a kite-surfing instructor to tell them what or how much to eat. With this newfound power, the YLC orders the correct amount of food the first time around, all while learning about Ethiopian culture. Abby reports back to her kite-surfing instructor, asking him for another suggestion for next week.</p>
<h4><a href="./#/personas/oberlin">The Gang</a></h4>
<p>
Finals, done! Now it’s time for The Gang to crash that new sushi place, Sushi Sushi. At a budget, of course! Both the gluten-free Ken and the vegetarian Taylor have no problem with it. Plus, they heard the selection is huge. Rumors shatter as the gang peers at the menu to find out it’s true. But with all this is sushi, they need to think about their budget. They spend almost too long for their grumbling stomachs trying to figure out what they can afford while maximizing the adventure before finally deciding just to get a double order of the sushi boat. Perhaps not the most adventurous choice. When presented with the bill, The Gang questions how it will be split. Zac did not eat much, but Carrie wolfed down two full rolls! After some frustrating collaboration, everyone tosses in what cash they have because none want to bother with figuring out the math. Zac is a tad irked that he had to pay more than his fair share. What could have been an adventurous dining experience had a slightly sour end.</p>
<p>
A successful solution would simplify what is commonly regarded as the most frustrating part of the meal: payment. Right away, The Gang knows what fits into their budget, how much they could get, and the maximum diversity of sushi they can afford. After that already brutal multivariable calculus test, no math or thinking is required. Their focus is solely on relaxing, socializing, and new eating things. At the end of the meal, people pay for what they think is fair. Zac no longer has to stress about using up his allowance, and the group stays strong for the tests that lie ahead.</p>

<h3 class="centered">Reflection</h3>
<p>As one can see from these narratives, a successful solution to this problem offers a wide range of possible benefits, from easily determining the group’s constraints, to aiding the group in the payment process. From our context inquiry, we are confident that a successful solution will impact the family-style dining experience in these ways and more.</p>
